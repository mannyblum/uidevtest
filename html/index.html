						<p><span class="upper">Manhattan, 
								Kan.</span> &mdash; The 
							Longhorns, three games into their 
							defense of the No. 
								1 ranking, come to a place where the opponent is 
								formidable, the 
								crowd is raucous, 
								and the referees 
								might just wear out 
								their 
								whistles.</p>

						<p>They come to face No. 13 Kansas State, an in-your-face team 
							that reflects the personality of its coach, Frank Martin.  
							The Wildcats spend much of their games fouling and 
							shooting free throws.</p>

						<p>All 12,528 tickets have been sold, and coach Rick Barnes 
							hopes the Longhorns can summon the fortitude Texas A&amp;M 
							showed in the packed Erwin Center on Saturday during 
							a 72-67 loss to the Longhorns in overtime.</p>

						<p>"It's gonna be flipped Monday," Barnes said. "We're not 
							gonna have the house.  I hope we go in with the same 
							intensity A&amp;M brought."</p>

						<p>Kansas State has 13 consecutive victories at home, its 
							longest streak in Manhattan since winning 20 straight in 
							1981-82.</p>

						<p>The Longhorns and Wildcats would not be called rivals, but 
							you couldn't tell by their games in recent seasons.</p>

						<p>Barnes is 8-4 against Kansas State. The Longhorns have won 
							four of the last six, but five of those games were decided 
							by four points or fewer.  Texas has won the last two in 
							Manhattan. K-State has a two-game winning steak in 
							Austin.</p>
